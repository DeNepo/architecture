# Stepped

Developing projects in this module will have 3 phases:

1. **Data**: define that data that will be in your application. this is also the phase when you should write a schema for your data, but the stepped examples won't have schemas to keep the files shorter
2. **Business Logic**: develop the _business logic_ and _utils_ (if you need utils). In this phase you are developing all the interactions a user can have with the data in isolation, without a user interface.
3. **Presentation**: develop the interface that allows a user to _use_ the business logic you developed in phase 1.
